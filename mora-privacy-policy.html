        <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Mora does not collect any personal information related to your hydration or usage within the app. However, we do use third-party services to track errors and improve the app's performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Error Tracking with Sentry</h2>
        <p>Mora uses <strong>Sentry</strong>, a third-party service, to collect and track error reports. This helps us identify and fix issues in the app. When an error occurs, Sentry may collect technical information such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (model, OS version, etc.)</li>
            <li>Error details (stack traces, crash reports, etc.)</li>
            <li>IP address (for troubleshooting purposes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No personally identifiable information is collected by Sentry. The data is used solely for debugging and improving the app's stability.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>3. How We Use the App</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal data, your water tracking experience is completely private and stored locally on your device. The error data collected via Sentry is used to improve app functionality and user experience.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>In addition to Sentry, we do not use any other third-party services that collect or share data from users. We do not use analytics tools, advertising networks, or other third-party integrations that track personal information.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>Since Mora does not store any personal or usage data, there are no direct security concerns regarding your personal information. However, the error data sent to Sentry is protected according to Sentry's privacy practices, which we recommend reviewing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>As Mora does not collect personal information or store usage data, you do not need to worry about controlling or deleting any data. Your experience with the app is private and secure, with only technical error data shared with Sentry for performance improvement purposes.</p>
